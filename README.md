# Stanford-MachineLearning
Files include projects related to the Machine Learning course offered by Andrew Ng. They cover various ML algorithms and problems, such as linear/non-linear regression, classification, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and bias/variance theory. 
Codes are written in MATLAB. To implement each project, run the main ex#.m (like ex4.m) in each folder. Maker sure to include all the files related to each project in your directory.
